## Diversification of Crocodiles

<a href="/images/croc-evol-cover.jpg"><img class="image-float-right" width="40%" style="border:1px solid black" src="/images/croc-evol-cover-small.jpg"></a>
Traditionally, crocodiles (*Crocodylus*) were stereotyped as an ancient group
of "living fossils" that originated in Africa; their diversity and
circumtropical distribution was attributed to vicariance via continental drift.
However, early molecular data and subsequent reassessment of paleontological
data suggested the genus might be younger than previously believed.
I collected a multi-locus dataset of all extant crocodylian species and used
statistical phylogenetic methods to infer the temporal and biogeographical
origin of *Crocodylus*.
The data were strongly inconsistent with the hypothesis of an African origin of
*Crocodylus*, and supported a recent and dynamic evolutionary history of the
genus.
My results strongly support that all extant crocodiles shared a common ancestor
from the tropics of the Indo-Pacific, approximately 14--8 million years ago
(mya), rejecting an ancient vicariant explanation of their biogeography in
favor of a recent, dispersal-mediated model involving multiple transoceanic
dispersals.
It was not until after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, when the global
climate was cooling and fellow crocodylian lineages were suffering massive
extinctions, that *Crocodylus* radiated and dispersed around the globe.
These findings raise interesting questions about how and why *Crocodylus* fared
so well during a period with the highest crocodilian extinction rate over the
last 100 million years.
