Generally, we are interested in using the shared ancestry inherent to
all life to

1.  learn about evolutionary history,
2.  better understand the processes that generate biological diversity, and
3.  analyze biological data within a coherent framework that accounts for
    shared ancestry.

Estimating common ancestry and accounting for it in analyses of biological data
falls within the field of *phylogenetics*.


Our work entails a variety of day-to-day tasks, including:

1.  Collection-based fieldwork.
2.  Molecular lab work to collect genetic data.
3.  Developing and implementing statistical methods that allow us to test our
    hypotheses. This allows us to frame our work around questions that excite
    us, rather than framing our questions around available methods.
