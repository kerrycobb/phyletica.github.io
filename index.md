Welcome to the Phyletica Lab, which is setting up shop next fall in the
[Department of Biological Sciences](http://www.auburn.edu/biology) and [Musuem
of Natural History](http://www.aumnh.org) at [Auburn
University](http://www.auburn.edu).
My name is [Jamie Oaks][1], and I start as an Assistant Professor at Auburn in
August 2016. Currently, I am an [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow][2] working
with [Adam LeachÃ©][3] and [Vladimir Minin][4] at the [University of
Washington][5].
I recently received my Ph.D.
from the [University of Kansas][6] working with [Rafe Brown][7] and [Mark
Holder][8].

The Phyletica Lab is broadly interested in understanding how and why there are
so many species on our planet.
To approach this question, we explore patterns of variation within and among
populations of organisms to infer evolutionary history and test models of
diversification.
This entails developing phylogenetic models, implementing them as computational
methods, and ultimately applying these methods to molecular data collected from
natural populations.
The focus of our empirical work is reptiles and amphibians, however, we also
work with systems ranging from viruses to plants.

On this site, you can find more information about our ongoing [research][9],
[teaching][10], and [software development][11], as well as read our [blog][12]
where we post along the way. Thanks for visiting.
