Welcome. My name is [Jamie Oaks][1]. I am an evolutionary biologist and [NSF
Postdoctoral Research Fellow][2] working with [Adam Leach√©][3] and [Vladimir
Minin][4] at the [University of Washington][5]. I recently received my Ph.D.
from the [University of Kansas][6] working with [Rafe Brown][7] and [Mark
Holder][8].

I am broadly interested in better understanding the evolutionary processes
underlying the generation, maintanence, and assembly of biodiversity. To
approach this problem, I explore DNA sequence variation within and among
populations of organisms in a statistical framework to test for patterns
predicted by ecological factors and historical events, such as climate change
and sea-level fluctuations. This entails developing and implementing
evolutionary models and ultimately applying them to molecular data collected
from natural populations, usually in a phylogenetic and comparative framework.

On this site, you can find more information about my ongoing [research][9],
[teaching][10], and [software development][11], as well as read my [blog][12]
where I post along the way. You can also find my CV [here][13]. Thanks for
visiting. This site is still under construction, so come back soon!
