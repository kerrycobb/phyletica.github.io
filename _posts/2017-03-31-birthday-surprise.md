A huge thanks to my great lab group for throwing a surprise birthday party
for me during our regularly scheduled lab meeting!
The party was well orchestrated, and included delicious Cajun eats from [Big
Blue Crawfish](https://www.facebook.com/bigbluecrawfish/).
They even made arrangements with [Big Blue
Crawfish](https://www.facebook.com/bigbluecrawfish/) to open early to have the
food ready in time for the big surprise!
I couldn't ask for a better lab group!
