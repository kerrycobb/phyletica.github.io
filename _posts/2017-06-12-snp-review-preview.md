[Adam Leach√©](http://faculty.washington.edu/leache/wordpress/)
and I wrote a review paper about the utility of SNPs in phylogenetics.
A preview of the abstract is now availabe on the
[AREES website](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022645).
Hopefully, the whole paper will be available soon!
