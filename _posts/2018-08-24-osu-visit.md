I am flying back down to Alabama after visiting the
[Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology](https://eeob.osu.edu/)
at
[Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/)
to give a seminar.
The Phyletica Lab was up here
in June for the [SSB Meeting]({{ site.baseurl }}/ssb-recap/),
and it was great to be back.

One of the highlights of the visit was the graduate students of the EEOB
Department.
I was impressed by how many of them attended the pizza lunch and seminar, and how
many signed up to meet with me individually.
They asked a lot of great questions that already have me thinking about future
research directions.

Many thanks to [Bryan Carsten's lab](https://carstenslab.osu.edu/) for hosting
and Megan Smith for organizing my visit.

Here are the slides from my talk:
