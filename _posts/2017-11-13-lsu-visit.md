Last week, I had a great time visiting the
[Biological Sciences Department](http://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/)
at
[Louisiana State University](http://www.lsu.edu/)
to give a
seminar.
It was my first time spending time on campus since I finished my Masters degree
there back in 2007.
It was a blast revisiting my old stomping grounds and meeting with some of the
many great faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in the department and
[Museum of Natural Science](http://www.lsu.edu/mns/).

Many thanks to [Jeremy Brown's lab](http://www.phyleaux1.lsu.edu/) for hosting
my visit, [Carl Oliveros](http://carloliveros.weebly.com/) for orchestrating,
and Dolly and [Jake Esselstyn](http://www.museum.lsu.edu/esselstyn/) for
holding a reception at their house.

Here are the slides from my talk:
