We are looking forward to the comparative phylogeography workshop at the
[SSB meeting in Columbus, Ohio](https://eeob.osu.edu/ssb2018).
If you are participating, before the workshop, please try installing the
software that we will be using.
This will allow us to cover more interesting material during our time together
and will lessen our reliance on guest WiFi.
Instructions for installing the software are here:

<http://phyletica.org/ecoevolity/installation.html>

Please install ecoevolity and pycoevolity, the R packages used by pycoevolity,
and the example data (this is all explained at the link).
Either direct installation or getting the Docker image is fine (also explained
at the link).
Also, though not required, I recommend you also install Tracer for visualizing
MCMC chain output from ecoevolity:

<http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/>

You will also need a plain text editor; Sublime Text
(<http://www.sublimetext.com/>) is a nice example.

Lastly, it might be helpful to read the preprint that describes the method
implemented in ecoevolity
(<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/324525>).
We will cover some of the theory behind the method at the beginning of the
workshop, but having some context will likely help.

If you run into trouble installing ecoevolity and/or pycoevolity, please use
the community forum to seek help:

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ecoevolity-users>

Thank you for your help with making the workshop run smoothly. See you in
Columbus!
