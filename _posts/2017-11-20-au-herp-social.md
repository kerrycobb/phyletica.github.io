On Friday, Melissa and I hosted a social for herpetologists associated
with [Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/).
During the social, Phyletica Lab Postdoc, [Jesse
Grismer](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/jesse-grismer/), presented a very
entertaining travelogue about some of his field work in Southeast Asia.

We all had a great time.
The next morning, I could not help taking advantage of the borrowed HD
projector to do some big-screen code testing and manuscript writing from the
couch.
