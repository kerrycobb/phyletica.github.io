A
[new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/20/395434)
out of the lab tests the predictions of a climate-driven model
of vicariant speciation (the "species-pump" model) across
the Philippine Islands.
After the better part of a decade, we finally have the data and method
necessary to robustly test the predictions of this model.
We collected comparative genomic (RADseq) data from 16 pairs of *Gekko* and
*Cyrtodactylus* populations and analyzed these data with our
new full-likelihood Bayesian comparative biogeographic method,
[ecoevolity](http://phyletica.org/ecoevolity).

Our results support independent divergence times across the gekkonid taxa,
**not** temporally clustered divergences as predicted by the species-pump
model.
We need to collect genomic data from more taxa across the islands to "rule out"
the species-pump model, but these results demonstrate that diversification is
much more dynamic across the archipelago than assumed by the often-invoked
paradigm of Pleistocene vicariant diversification.
