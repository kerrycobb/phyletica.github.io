Charlotte Benedict, Kerry Cobb, and I had a great time at
[Evolution 2019](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html)
in Providence, RI.
Charlotte presented a great poster on the independent evolution of clownfish
symbiosis among sea anemones.
Kerry gave a poster about our work showing the difficulty of estimating
simultaneous demographic changes among populations
(see
[post here]({{ site.baseurl }}/codemog-preprint/)
and
[preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679878v1)).
I talked about our
[recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.13754)
on the comparative biogeography of Philippine geckos.
The slides from my talk are available for
[download here]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/evol2019.pdf)
and can be viewed via 
[SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/jamieoaks7/full-bayesian-comparative-biogeography-of-philippine-geckos-challenges-predictions-of-climatedriven-vicariant-speciation)

Kerry and I also attended the
[iEvoBio Conference](https://ievobio2019.github.io/2019-iEvoBio/index.html)
the day after evolution, for
which I was a member of a panel on computational biology education.
The slides from my iEvoBio presentation can be
[viewed here]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/ievobio-2019).

We enjoyed our time in Providence and learned a ton from all the amazing talks
and posters we attended.
A huge thanks to the
[ASN](https://www.amnat.org/home.html),
[SSB](https://www.systbio.org/),
[SSE](https://www.evolutionsociety.org/),
and all the conference organizers for a wonderful event.
