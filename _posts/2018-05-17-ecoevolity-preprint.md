A
[new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/324525)
out of the lab introduces the new method
[ecoevolity](https://github.com/phyletica/ecoevolity).
The
[documentation](http://phyletica.org/ecoevolity)
for the new software is a bit sparse at the moment, but will improve rapidly
(there's a looming workshop coming up!).
Checkout the 
[open-science repository](https://github.com/phyletica/ecoevolity-experiments)
for the project if you want all the details.

Oh, why the name "ecoevolity?" Well, it stands for ***E***stimating
***evo***lutionary ***coevality***. Coevolity is a mash-up of evolution and
[coevality](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coevality).
What does coevality mean? Being of the same age (the noun form of
[coeval](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coeval)).
