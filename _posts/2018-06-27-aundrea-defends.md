## Congrats to Aundrea!

Congratulations to Aundrea Westfall for successfully defending her Master's
Thesis!
She found evidence that the insulin/insulin-like signaling network is involved
in the evolution of viviparity (live birth) in fence lizards, but different
parts of the network are involved in different, independent transitions to live
birth; really great work and seminar.
Aundrea was the best first M.S. student a PI could hope for;
she will be missed!
Aundrea is joining
[Todd Castoe's Lab](http://www.snakegenomics.org/CastoeLab/Castoe_Lab_Home.html)
this Fall at the University of Texas Arlington.
