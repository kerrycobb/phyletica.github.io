## Marginal likelihoods in phylogenetics: a review of methods and applications

A
[new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04072)
out of the lab reviews the theory, methods, and applications of marginal
likelihoods in Bayesian phylogenetics.
We couldn't resist throwing in a few simulations to test the predicted behavior
of one marginal likelihood estimator.
Yes, a review paper with supplemental material.

Check out the slick
[interactive plots](https://kerrycobb.github.io/beta-binomial-web-demo/)
that Kerry Cobb developed to accompany the paper!
I'm glad someone in the lab knows javascript better than me.
