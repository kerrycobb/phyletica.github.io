I posted an
[updated version of the preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/30/324525)
that introduces the new method
[ecoevolity](https://github.com/phyletica/ecoevolity).
The updates are relatively minor, but there are new plots in the Supporting
Information that illustrate the model-choice accuracy of the new method, which
complement the plots that show the accuracy of estimating the number of
divergence events.

Also, thanks to the
[workshop at the SSB Meeting]({{ site.baseurl }}/ssb-workshop/)
in June,
[the documentation](http://phyletica.org/ecoevolity)
is much improved.
Checkout the 
[open-science repository](https://github.com/phyletica/ecoevolity-experiments)
for the project if you want all the details.
