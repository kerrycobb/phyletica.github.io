Yesterday, my daughter, Amalie, and I went for a walk in the
[Louise Kreher Forest Ecology Preserve](http://www.auburn.edu/main/welcome/forestry.html)
north of downtown Auburn.
It was a beautiful day, and we found a really cute red salamander
(*Pseudotriton ruber*) under a log along a small creek.
It's a great time of year for salamanders around Auburn!
