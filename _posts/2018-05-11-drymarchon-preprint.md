## Preprint out of the lab on the taxonomic status of Eastern Indigo Snakes

A
[new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/318766)
is up on bioRxiv by
[Brian Folt](https://brianfolt.com/)
and colleagues on the taxonomic status of the Eastern Indigo Snake.
With more genetic and morphological data, we find support for only one species.
Not surprisingly, the clades found from mitochondrial sequence data that
loosely coincide with geography do not delimit isolated lineages.
This appears to be an example of a spurious
[phylogeographic break without geographic barriers to gene flow](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00164.x).
