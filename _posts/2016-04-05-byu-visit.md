Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting the
[Biology Department](http://biology.byu.edu/)
of
[BYU](http://byu.edu/)
to give a
[seminar](http://www.slideshare.net/jamieoaks7/generalizing-phylogenetics-to-infer-shared-evolutionary-events)
on my research.
It was my first time visiting the Utah Valley.
Over the years, I have heard about the beauty of the area from many friends and
colleagues.
Tucked up against the Wasatch Range on the eastern edge of the Great
Basin, the Utah Valley was even more breathtaking than I expected.
The header photo above was taken through my hotel room window a few blocks
from the
[BYU](http://byu.edu/)
campus.
Below is a shot of Antelope Island (I think) from the airplane on our approach
to Salt Lake City International Airport.

I was hosted by the
[Lab of Dr. Jack Sites, Jr.](http://siteslab.byu.edu/),
and Jack and his lab members made my visit a lot of fun.
The morning before my seminar, Jack took me to Robert Redford's [Sundance
Mountain Resort](http://www.sundanceresort.com/), just a short drive up one of
the canyons from Provo.
I enjoyed learning about the history of the area and taking in the Mountain
Vistas surrounding the resort.
After returning to Provo, Jack gave me a tour of the
impressive research and collection facilities at the
[Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum](http://mlbean.byu.edu/).

I presented my seminar in the newly built Life Sciences Building (slides below).
The audience, composed of a good mix of students and faculty, was warmly
receptive and asked insightful questions.
Afterward, I met with several members of the
[Sites Lab](http://siteslab.byu.edu/),
all of whom are doing
cutting-edge collection-based biodiversity research all around the globe.

[Perry Wood, Jr.](http://perryleewoodjr.com/) (a.k.a. "JR") and I slipped out
of the department a bit early to enjoy a hike up one of the canyons near
campus. I was told that Provo is usually snow-covered this time of year, but JR
and I had to gain quite a bit of elevation before we found snow. Instead we saw
budding trees and green moss along most of our hike.

My visit was capped off by enjoying the delectable cuts of meat at [Tucanos
Brazilian Grill](http://www.tucanos.com/menu.html) with members of the [Sites
Lab](http://siteslab.byu.edu/). The food was so good, I didn't need any
breakfast the next morning before hopping in the shuttle to the airport.

Overall, my trip to BYU was full of beautiful vistas, early spring weather,
welcoming colleagues, great science, and good eats.
I am left looking forward to my next visit to the Utah Valley, hopefully in the
not-too-distant future.
