There is a troubling association between forest fragmentation and an increase
of emerging infectious diseases spilling over into human populations.
A lot of important work has led to ecological explanations for this pattern.
In a [recent opinion piece](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2019.03.010),
[Sarah Zohdy](http://wp.auburn.edu/zohdylab/),
[Tonia Schwartz](https://www.schwartzlab-ecoevolutionarygenomics.org/),
and I propose an evolutionary mechanism for this pattern that we think can
complement ecological perspectives on this problem {% cite Zohdy2019 %}.
