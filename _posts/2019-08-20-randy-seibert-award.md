## Congrats to Randy!

Congratulations to Randy Klabacka for
[winning the prestigious Henri Seibert Award](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/news/articles/2019/08/auburn_student_honored_with_research_award_on_reptile_study.htm)
at the
[Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists](https://conferences.k-state.edu/jmih/).
This award from the
[Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles](https://ssarherps.org/)
recognizes the student with the best talk in one of four research categories.
Randy was awarded the best talk in Evolution/Systematics for his presentation
on "Riverine barriers as potential drivers of biodiversification in the *Draco
maculatus* species complex of Indochina."
This project started out as a relatively simple exploration into this species
complex of gliding lizards.
However, Randy has done a great job transforming this work
into an in-depth comparison of
a large number of biogeographic models to determine the best explanation for
the current geographic distribution of this group's genetic diversity across
Indochina.
Auburn University published
[a nice story](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/news/articles/2019/08/auburn_student_honored_with_research_award_on_reptile_study.htm)
about Randy's accomplishment.
