The goal of this survey is to assess learning of students taking Applied
Phylogenetics. The survey will be administered at the beginning and end of each
quarter the course is offered. This will establish baseline data on how well
students are acquiring knowledge of fundamental concepts in phylogenetics, and,
over time, will allow for comparing the effectiveness of different teaching
strategies and course exercises.

You can download the survey [here][1].
