## Scripting for Biologists
(co-taught with [Scott Santos](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~santosr/))


### Learners
-   Biology graduate students
-   Required part of a Bioinformatics Certificate


### Content
-   Bash and Python scripting with version-control (Git) up front


### Delivery
-   All students get a free, temporary account on the Alabama Super Computer

-   Combination of interactive slides followed by a "test-driven exercise"\*\*

\*\*I stole this idea from
[this exercise](https://github.com/mtholder/swc-tree-support-ex)
by
[Mark Holder](http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/content/mark-t-holder)


Example slides:
-   <http://phyletica.org/slides/git-intro>
-   <http://phyletica.org/slides/python/intro>

Example TD exercises:
-   <https://github.com/joaks1/au-bootcamp-git-intro>
-   <https://github.com/joaks1/python-translation-project>



## Bioinformatics Bootcamp
([Scott Santos](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~santosr/),
[Ken Halanych](http://metazoan.auburn.edu/halanych/lab/),
[Les Goertzen](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/faculty/biology/goertzen/))


### Learners
-   Undergrad & grad students and postdocs from around the world


### Content
-   Crash course in biological computing, mostly geared toward high-throughput
    sequence data
-   My modules focus on
    -   Reproducibility in science via version control
    -   Basic Bash scripting and best practices


### Delivery
-   All participants get a free, temporary account on the ASC
-   Almost everything is done on the command line, logged into the ASC



## Computational Biology REU
(NSF award to
[Les Goertzen](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/faculty/biology/goertzen/))


### Shameless plug

Preprint by my REU student, Nadia L'Bahy:

<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679878v1"><img src="../images/codemog-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" style="border:0px;max-height: 500px;" /></a>

<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679878v1">
<small>Insights from a general, full-likelihood Bayesian approach to inferring shared
evolutionary events from genomic data: Inferring shared demographic events is
challenging</small>
</a>


### Learners
-   Undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds


### Content
-   Very diverse (mentor/mentee dependent)
-   All students participate in Bioinformatics Bootcamp


### Delivery
-   It varies, but all students get a free, temporary account on the ASC
-   REU students also receive a Raspberry Pi Zero


### Raspberry Pi: First session

<ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        Unboxing
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        Burn Raspbian to microSD and install on Pi
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        SSH to pi via USB cable and play around
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        We demo how to run the pi like a desktop (using monitor and keyboard)
    </ul>
</ul>

<p class="fragment fade-up">
    Subsequent sessions focus on scripting and bioinformatics exercises
</p>


### Benefits of Pi:

<ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        Makes what they are doing on the ASC much less abstract
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        Students get to keep it
	    <ul class="fragment fade-up">
            Enables life-long learners
        </ul>
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        SSH to pi via USB cable and play around
    </ul>
	<ul class="fragment fade-up">
        We demo how to run the pi like a desktop (using monitor and keyboard)
    </ul>
</ul>


### Weaknesses of Pi:

-   Takes time to set up   
    -   But, if you do this with the students, they can learn a lot!

-   Need other equipment to access
    -   We mainly SSH from a laptop
    -   Other option: Keyboard, mouse, and screen
        -   This could be kept cheap and re-used

-   Limited computational power



## Alabama Prison Arts + Education Project


### Learners
-   Students of all ages from diverse backgrounds
-   Best students ever!


### Content
-   So far, Evolutionary Biology, and Evolutionary Botany (with Wayne Barger)
-   Want to introduce more STEM, especially computing


### Delivery
-   So far, slides, whiteboard, and exercises
-   Working on plans/permission/funding for Raspberry Pis or Chromebooks, on
    which everything can be done locally
