        Jesse is interested in the systematics, biogeography, and conservation
        of reptile and amphibian species, and is a La Kretz Post doctoral
        fellow co-advised with Brad Shaffer at the University of California Los
        Angeles. Jesse's postdoctoral research will be focused on the
        conservation genomics of Southern California reptiles.

        and their hosts, and the evolution of gene families associated with
        blood parasitism.

    bio: >
        I am fascinated by the coevolutionary relationship between
        mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. I am interested in the role sexual
        reproduction plays in maintaining a healthy mitonuclear marriage, and
        analyzing the effects of parthenogenesis on mitochondrial dysfunction
        using physiological methods within a phylogenetic context.
