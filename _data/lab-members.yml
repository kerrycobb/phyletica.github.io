        I am fascinated by the coevolutionary relationship between
        mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. I am interested in the role sexual
        reproduction plays in maintaining a healthy mitonuclear marriage, and
        analyzing the effects of parthenogenesis on mitochondrial dysfunction
        using physiological methods within a phylogenetic context.
